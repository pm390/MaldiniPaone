We present UX diagrams showing the flow all type of users interacts with the system. There are repetitions in diagrams to show how mobile application users have lot of common interaction, the same applies also to the Web App. Every user when application starts up can login or ask to retrieve his/her lost login credentials. All user can also access statistics and modify their accountâ€™s data and credentials. The differences are in some screen available only for specific type of users. Citizen can create new account and make reports, authorities can take assignments and terminate them, municipality can register authorities but can also see suggestions, system manager and municipalities can register new municipalities.
