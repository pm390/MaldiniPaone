\subsection{Alloy Model Description}
The main goal of SafeStreets is to increase safety on the streets and, in order to reach this goal, it is important
that every report made by Citizens is taken care as fast as possible by authorities. We have modelled
a goal stating that every agent must be working on an assignment if he/she is not already dealing with
another. In the model there are only the entities that are relevant to that goal and simplification about
users’ location are made to make it more understandable. In addition, to make sure that our model
with domain assumptions and requirements makes it possible to reach the goal we set, we have also checked how different worlds may be generated and that some borderline cases aren’t ignored.
