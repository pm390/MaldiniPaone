\subsection{Alloy Model Description}
The main goal of SafeStreets is to increase safety on the strets , for reaching this goal it is importante that every report made by Citizens is taken care as fast as possible by authorities. We have modeled the goal stating that every agent must be working on an assignment if he/she is not already dealing with another. In the model there are only the entities that are relevant to this goal and semplification about users' location are made to make the model more understandable.
In addition to checking that our model with domain assumptions and requirements makes it possible to reach the goal we also checked how different worlds may be generated and that some borderline cases aren't ignored.
