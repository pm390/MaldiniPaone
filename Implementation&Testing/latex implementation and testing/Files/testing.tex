The System is divided in various subsystems:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mobile App
\item Web Application
\item Web Server
\item Application Server
\item DataBase Connection
\item DataBase Server 
\item External Systems:Google Maps,External DataBases
\end{itemize}
The subsystems not external will be implemented and tested. They will also be integrated together, and with external systems. Since the Web Server provides user only static data (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and is deployed to a different device than the web Application, this component can be implemented and tested in any moment during the development but the integration must be done when the full application is implemented. Given our design choice of having a multiple servlet server which communicates with DataBase through a facade, our implementation must have as a starting point the implementation of the DataBase Server and the connection with it.
